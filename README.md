Fun web application that queries the Giphy API to retrieve gifs for display.

The application has the ability to add/remove buttons from the search history, and retains this history state through usage of browser local storage.

This application is also responsive for mobile usage as well.

Written in/using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery.

Enjoy!
